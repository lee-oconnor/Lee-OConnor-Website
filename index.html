                    <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I've made my home base in Brooklyn, New York, with my daughter and partner. 
                           My journey into tech started with a degree in photography. I worked for many years as a photographer, 
                           but my creative curiosity never ceased. I've always been intrigued by the tech world, and as soon
                           as I built my very first HTML site from scratch, I was hooked.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned about front-end development,
                           I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in 
                           my work. Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my creative skills 
                           and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.

                        <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content
                           is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean
                           and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.

                        <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
                        <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that
                           is pixel-perfect match.
